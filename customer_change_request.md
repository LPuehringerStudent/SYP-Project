# Customer Change Requests

Here is the process steps:

### 1. Listen to the request  
We will first talk with the customer to understand exactly what they want to change. Then we document it.

### 2. Check the impact
We will look at how the change affects the project’s time, cost, and work already done.

### 3. Explain the impact  
We will share the results with the customer so they know what the change means for the project.

### 4. Get approval  
If the customer agrees with the impact, we will document the change and get their approval.

### 5. Update the plan  
We will update the project schedule, tasks, and budget to include the approved change.

### 6. Do the work 
After everything is clear and approved, we will start working on the change.
