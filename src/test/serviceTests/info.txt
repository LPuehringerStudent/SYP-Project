The serviceTests/ folder should be populated with direct service unit tests that:

  1. Test service methods in isolation (without HTTP layer)
  2. Test database transaction handling
  3. Test edge cases and error conditions
  4. Test the Unit class database utilities

  This would improve coverage and catch issues at the business logic level, not just at the API level.
